<h1>This is the Sanders Family</h1>

<p>My name is Hazen Sanders. I've been in the military for about 14 years now. I came in<p>
<p>as a Fuels guy, but ended up in the weather careerfield after about 6 years.<p> 
<p>My hobbies are playing sports, weight lifting, driving and working on <p>
<p>fast cars, and hanging out with my family in my free time.</p>

<p>This is my wife Chadsidy Sanders. We have been married for 14 years. She is an IT Specialist<p>
<p>for the Army. Her hobbies include traveling, shopping, playing sports and <p>
<p>supporting our children in one of the many sports that they do every week.</p>

<p>This is my daughter Haven Sanders. She is one of the most adventurous little girls you<p>
<p>will ever meet at 7 years old. She plays soccer, does ballet, and plays basketball</p>

<p>This is my son Hazen Sanders Jr. He is a little boy.....mischievous, outgoing, and<p>
<p>all-around <em>FEARLESS<em><p>
