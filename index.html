<p>This is my first try at a basic wep page. Before the class is over I would like to make a static webage that provides knowledge on my journey throughout Europe equipped with hyperlinks, pictures, and references.</p>

<p>I have never done any coding but it has always been something that I have wanted to try. With this page I would like to slowly build it into a good final project</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>I would like to have links to different government pages and all the best tourist spots</p>

<p><a href="http://www.governo.it/">Welcome to Italy!</a></p>

<p>I plan of doing something of a timeline of events from all the trips I have taken</p>
