<p>This is my first try at a basic wep page. Before the classe is over I would like to make a static webage that provides knowledge on my journey to the end equipped with hyperlinks, pictures, and references.</p>

<p>I have never done any coding but it has always been something that I have wanted to try. With this page I would like to slowly build it into a good final project</p>

<h2>Wikipedia based knowledge</h2>

<p>I also want to make it more eye catching with different color schemes and some type of interactive feature</p>
