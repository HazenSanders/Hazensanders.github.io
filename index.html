<h1 style="background-color:Tomato;">04 October, 2020 Hazen Sanders</h1>

<p>My name is Hazen Sanders. I've been in the military for about 14 years now. I came in as a Fuels guy, but ended up in the weather careerfield after about 6 years. My hobbies are playing sports, weight lifting, driving and working on fast cars, and hanging out with my family in my free time.</p>

<p>I have never done any coding but it has always been something that I have wanted to try. With this page I would like to slowly build it into a good final project. I plan on doing some type of IT job when I retire so I figured that taking a coding classes and learning the basics would be a good start. I'm going to attach a couple of link to place I have been for your enjoyment.</p>
